## üöÄ About Me
üëã About Me
I'm a passionate and results-driven .NET Full Stack Developer with a strong command of backend development using ASP.NET Core / .NET Framework, paired with hands-on expertise in AngularJS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for building responsive, dynamic frontends.

I specialize in designing scalable APIs, building real-world business applications, and integrating complex systems with clean architecture principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS). I thrive in full-stack environments where performance, maintainability, and developer experience matter.

In every project I work on, I strive to:

Write clean, readable, and testable code

Use efficient database operations with Entity Framework Core, LINQ, and optimized SQL

Follow component-based UI architecture for reusability

Apply best practices for code organization, scalability, and performance

üîÑ I'm continuously learning modern tech stacks, improving JavaScript proficiency, and exploring cross-platform solutions like .NET MAUI and Playwright for automation.
üìà I believe in iterative growth, building for the long term, and shipping value fast.

‚ÄúCode is a tool. Problem-solving is the skill.‚Äù ‚Äì That‚Äôs how I approach every challenge.
